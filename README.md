## IMAGINARY FEATURE: Code Time Capsule
- A Code Time Capsule is a feature that can import or export written source codes across different programming languages from different years.
- It contains information about the several programming languages that are improved across time.
- This ensures providing access to future programmers to explore programming languages that may not be used in the future.

**LONG LIVE, PROGRAMMERS AND DEVELOPERS!**
